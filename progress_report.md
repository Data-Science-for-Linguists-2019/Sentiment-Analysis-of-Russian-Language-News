Sharing plan
-----------
I will probably put all my files on GitHub publicly, so people can just download them if they want. As far as I can tell none of the sites limit sharing of their articles except maybe Reuters, which is sort of vague about its policy (it just says it is in line with Norwegian copyright law). Other than that most of their policies seem to permit sharing if it doesn't earn me profit.
